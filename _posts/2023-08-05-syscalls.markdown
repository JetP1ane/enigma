## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, endpoint protection has become a crucial line of defense against cyber threats. Endpoint security solutions aim to safeguard individual devices, such as laptops, desktops, and mobile devices, from various forms of malicious attacks. These security measures are designed to detect, prevent, and remediate potential threats in real-time.

However, as endpoint protection solutions have grown more sophisticated, so have the tactics employed by cyber adversaries. Traditional methods of evasion are no longer sufficient to bypass the ever-vigilant defenses of modern endpoint protection systems.

### The Challenge of Evading Endpoint Protection

Endpoint protection solutions often employ a combination of signature-based detection, behavior analysis, machine learning, and heuristics to identify and block potential threats. While these techniques have significantly enhanced the security posture of organizations, they have also spurred the development of advanced evasion tactics by malicious actors.

Modern evasion tactics are designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms, such as polymorphic malware, fileless attacks, and living-off-the-land techniques. These tactics allow malicious software to hide in plain sight, making it extremely challenging for security solutions to detect their presence.

### The Need for Advanced Evasion Techniques

As the threat landscape continues to evolve, the need for advanced evasion techniques becomes paramount for offensive security practitioners and red teams. To assess the effectiveness of an organization's security measures and identify potential vulnerabilities, security professionals must employ evasion techniques that emulate the tactics of real-world adversaries.

By understanding and implementing modern evasion tactics, red teams can simulate sophisticated cyberattacks that expose weak points in an organization's defenses. This approach enables businesses to proactively improve their security posture, stay ahead of emerging threats, and bolster their endpoint protection capabilities.

In this blog post, we will explore cutting-edge evasion tactics used to bypass modern endpoint protection solutions. By comprehending these advanced techniques, security professionals can better fortify their networks, enhance their incident response strategies, and be better prepared to face the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats.


## Section 1: Understanding Direct Syscalls in Windows

In the realm of Windows operating systems, syscalls (system calls) are fundamental mechanisms that enable user-mode applications to interact with the kernel. Syscalls provide a way for user-space processes to request services or access system functionalities that require elevated privileges.

### What are Syscalls in Windows?

Syscalls in Windows serve as an interface between user-mode applications and the Windows kernel. They offer a controlled entry point for user programs to request actions that would otherwise be restricted due to their sensitive nature. Syscalls allow user-mode applications to communicate with kernel-mode components, which manage core operating system functions.

Some common examples of syscalls in Windows include:

- `NtCreateFile`: To create or open files or devices.
- `NtReadFile`: To read data from files or devices.
- `NtWriteFile`: To write data to files or devices.
- `NtClose`: To close files or devices after usage.
- `NtCreateProcess`: To create a new process.
- `NtTerminateProcess`: To terminate a process.

### Syscalls in Malware Development

In the context of malware development, syscalls play a crucial role in the execution and evasion of malicious code. Malware leverages syscalls to interact directly with the Windows kernel, enabling it to execute privileged operations and avoid detection by security software that monitors higher-level API calls.

Malware developers use syscalls for several reasons:

#### 1. Evasion and Stealth

By utilizing direct syscalls, malware can evade detection by traditional security solutions that focus on monitoring API calls. This low-level interaction with the kernel allows the malware to operate stealthily and avoid triggering alarms or leaving traces.

#### 2. Direct Kernel Access

Syscalls provide malware with direct access to the Windows kernel, enabling it to manipulate critical system structures, inject malicious code into other processes, or modify system configurations. This level of access grants the malware significant control over the compromised system.

#### 3. Custom Functionality

Malware can leverage syscalls to implement custom functionality tailored to its specific objectives. Bypassing higher-level APIs, the malware can directly control hardware, intercept network traffic, or execute intricate actions customized for the targeted system.

In conclusion, syscalls in Windows are crucial mechanisms that allow user-mode applications to interact with the kernel. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, such as malware developers, syscalls can be exploited to create sophisticated and evasive malware. Understanding the role of syscalls is essential for both offensive and defensive security practitioners, as it provides insights into how malware can leverage these low-level mechanisms for stealthy and impactful attacks.
